Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
     I was tasked with creating the game of monopoly that two people could play.

What did you do particularly well?
     I wanted customization when creating this game. I wanted the ability change colors, names, values, and other variables that could cause different rulesets. The values of properties and other rules are read in from text files. If you want If you want different rulesets, simply create a new text file.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
     As of now, the project is still not finished. There are still plenty of game rules that need to be added in, such as winning the game and rules for jail. By adding these, the game would be more enjoyable to play. 

 Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
     One challenge I faced, and still face, is working with chance and community chest cards. Because I want to be able to change these in the future, I need to create a method that will perform the action on the card. I plan on using enums and reworking this because as of now, each card has its own method that is called when a card is drawn. As far as the tools being used to support me in this project? Google, Google, and Google! When this project started, I was working with a team. Shortly after starting, the project became too difficult and confusing for them, and they slowly left. This left me to work by myself on the project. While I am not the first person to create the game of Monopoly, I have not seen anyone try to create it in the same way as me. It would be impossible to go to one person for all my answers, and so I have spent time searching for ways to complete simple and similar tasks from online communities. By doing this I have been able to piece together this project.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
     Everything from this project can be of help later in my career. This project uses OOP, GUI, reading and writing to files, use of variables, and methods. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
     I have tried to break this project down to simple tasks. This has made what seems like an overwhelming project become manageable. The use of whitespace and comments has helped a bunch too. Every method has a comment, each class has a header, and within some methods I have placed inline comments explaining fixes that need to be made.
